we propose a lossless encryption algorithm for medical images, which is based on a guided image generative neural network. Initially, we designed a guided image generation network. Subsequently, we train a generator using random keys to produce a key map. This key map then guides the encryption of the secret image through a bitwise XOR (bit-XOR) algorithm, effectively merging the secret image with the key map. During the decryption process, the original image can be restored losslessly by utilizing a key map generated from a random key. The experimental results show that the encryption algorithm greatly ensures the security of data and shows strong anti-attack ability.
